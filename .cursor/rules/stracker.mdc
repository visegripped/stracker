The contents of the secretSauce file must always remain secret.  If unit tests are added, those too should be in the .gitignore file
any password or API key required should be in the passwords.php file

The site checks a variety of stock prices each day and calculates based on a series of formulas and uses those to determine alerts which are buy signals.  

Alerts are measured by P0, P1 and P2 where P0 is a must buy and the other two are early indicators.
